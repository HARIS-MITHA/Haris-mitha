Compiler:
A compiler is a program that translates high-level source code written in a 
programming language into machine code or an intermediate code, facilitating the 
execution of programs on a computer.
Interpreter:
An interpreter is a program that directly executes source code written in a 
programming language, translating and executing each line or statement in real-time 
rather than generating a separate machine code beforehand.
